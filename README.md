# PyBolt
PyBolt is a Python framework for the computation of dark matter relic density and energy distribution. The framework allows to construct models with the parameters and processes provided by the user (or selected from the library of classes) and to solve number density Boltzmann equation or the Boltzmann equation for the phase-space density for the given models.

## Current version

The current version includes only the process of 2-body decays that produce one dark matter particle, which is the case of some dark radiation models like axions from lepton flavor-violating decays. Please use the 'UsingFBE_decay' notebook as an explanatory example of using PyBolt.
